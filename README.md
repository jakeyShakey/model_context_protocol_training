# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Implementation Guide

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive Slidev presentation on implementing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI integration projects. The presentation covers the core architecture of MCP, practical examples, and best practices for developers working with Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude and other AI systems.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an API standard developed by Anthropic that enables seamless LLM tool integration in AI applications. It provides a structured approach to context management for AI agents and establishes a consistent protocol for communication between LLMs and external tools.

## Presentation Contents

This developer guide and tutorial covers:

- **Core Architecture**: Understanding the fundamental components of the Model Context Protocol
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for implementing MCP clients and servers (with Python examples)
- **AI Integration Patterns**: Best practices for integrating external tools with LLMs
- **Tool Use Examples**: Practical demonstrations of agentic AI capabilities
- **Use Cases**: Real-world applications including the Tableau integration example

## Getting Started

To view this presentation:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) if you haven't already
3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`)
4. Run `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`)
5. Open your browser to the URL displayed in the terminal

## Why Model Context Protocol?

When developing AI applications that require tool integration, the Model Context Protocol offers several advantages:

- **Standardized Communication**: Consistent JSON-RPC based protocol for AI-tool interactions
- **Context Management**: Efficient handling of context between the LLM and external systems
- **Simplified Development**: Clear patterns for building agentic AI applications
- **Extensibility**: Easy integration with new tools and services

## Use Cases

The MCP approach is valuable for various artificial intelligence and machine learning applications, including:

- Data analysis pipelines with tools like Tableau
- AI assistants that interact with external services
- Custom LLM tool development
- Building comprehensive AI agents with multiple capabilities
